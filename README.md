#### ***NPM*** is the world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use ***NPM*** to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use ***NPM*** to manage private development as well.

---

***NPM*** consists of three distinct components:

-   the website
-   the Command Line Interface (CLI)
-   the registry

Use the [*website*](https://npmjs.com/) to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your ***NPM*** experience. For example, you can set up [organizations](https://www.npmjs.com/features) to manage access to public or private packages.

The [*CLI*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with ***NPM***.

The [*registry*](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry) is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.

---

## Use ***NPM*** to . . .

-   Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
-   Download standalone tools you can use right away.
-   Run packages without downloading using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).
-   Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
-   Restrict code to specific developers.
-   Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
-   Form virtual teams by using organizations.
-   Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
-   Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
-   Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
-   Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

## Getting started

To get started with ***NPM***, you can [create an account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup), which will be available at <http://www.npmjs.com/~*yourusername>*.

After you set up an ***NPM*** account, the next step is to use the command line interface (CLI) to [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). We look forward to seeing what you create!

---

Sharing packages and collaborating with others

If you choose to share your packages publicly, there is no cost. To use and share private packages, you need to upgrade your account. To share with others, create organizations, called **[npm organizations](https://docs.npmjs.com/organizations)**, and invite others to work with you, privately (for a fee) or publicly (for free). Or you can sign up for a private instance of ***NPM*** for your company, called **[npm Enterprise](https://npmjs.com/enterprise)**, so you can develop packages internally that are not shared publicly.

## Organizations

Organizations allow teams of contributors to read, write, and public and private packages. Organizations are free when they publish public packages. When organizations publish private packages, an npm Teams subscription is required. For more information on ***NPM*** Teams pricing, see our [products page](https://www.npmjs.com/pricing).
